# 1.	Project title:  Tess – The MedEEdoc Assistant
  
  
Description of problem: 

Across nearly every health care specialty, EMRs are a known source of frustration, stress, and burnout for physicians. An assessment of 1752 practicing family physicians found that 44.6% (782) believed they spend an excessive or moderately high amount of time working on EMRs at home.  A study of 27 ophthalmologists from November reported that a mean of 27% of an ophthalmologist’s time with a patient is spent on EMR use—equating to nearly 4 hours per day.  
Researchers noted the primary purpose of EMR implementation was to improve the patient billing process but acknowledged that the increased documentation requirements of such systems have unintended clinical consequences.

“Accurate documentation and billing are easily obtainable with EMRs”. So, our approach for is to deliver reliable EMR using a voice assistant which follows the voice commands and generate the electronic document about the medical situation of the patient.

# “We turn fertile lands into deserts by using ineffective farming technologies. There is no future until we return to organic farming and save the soil.” – Team 11
  
Description of problem: 

We intend to create a one-stop website that will connect individuals with local organic botanist and experienced organic farming owners. The website will provide customers with a link for online consultations with experienced botanists, as well as an online organic store for prescribed organic pesticides and gardening daily necessities, eliminating the need for them to go out and look for the best organic insecticides and pesticides. The website will also include map directions to neighboring organic farms, and get to know about their farming techniques. The customers can post and view the content related to organic farming in the form of articles and videos.

 

# 3.Project title: Pet Finder
  
  
Description of problem: 

A thousand words are worth a thousand pictures. But did you know that a single photograph can save a thousand lives? Every day, millions of stray animals suffer on the streets or are euthanized in shelters all over the world. You'd think that pets with appealing photos would pique people's interest and be adopted faster. But what exactly constitutes a good photograph? With the help of data science, you may be able to accurately determine the appeal of a pet photo and even recommend improvements to give these rescue animals a better chance of finding loving homes. 

PetFinder.my is Malaysia's leading animal welfare platform, with over 180,000 animals, 54,000 of which have been happily adopted. To improve animal welfare, Petfinder works closely with animal lovers, the media, corporations, and global organizations.


Currently, PetFinder.my ranks pet photos using a simple Cuteness Meter. It compares the performance of thousands of pet profiles to image composition and other factors. While this basic tool is useful, it is still in the early stages of development, and the algorithm could be improved. 

To predict the "Pawpularity" of pet photos, raw images and metadata are analyzed. You'll train and test your model on thousands of pet profiles on PetFinder.my. Winning versions will provide precise recommendations to improve animal welfare. 

The solution will be incorporated into AI tools that will assist shelters and rescuers worldwide in improving the appeal of their pet profiles by automatically enhancing photo quality and recommending composition improvements. As a result, stray dogs and cats have a better chance of finding "forever" homes much faster.
