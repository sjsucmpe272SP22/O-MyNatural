Description of problem: 

We intend to create a one-stop website that will connect individuals with local organic botanist and experienced organic farming owners. The website will provide customers with a link for online consultations with experienced botanists, as well as an online organic store for prescribed organic pesticides and gardening daily necessities, eliminating the need for them to go out and look for the best organic insecticides and pesticides. The website will also include map directions to neighboring organic farms, and get to know about their farming techniques. The customers can post and view the content related to organic farming in the form of articles and videos.
